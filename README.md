# Facebook and Immaterial Digital Labor

**A workshop that explores modes of resistance on the social platform**

As Facebook users, our everyday interactions with the platform fuel a complex business model that monetizes, commodifies, and produces a self from our data. All the things we do on Facebook for free - offer up our location, our comments, our likes - become a form of invisible digital labor that Facebook turns into profit.

In this workshop, we will discuss strategies for resisting and altering the Facebook user experience. How can we speculate about different ways of engaging with Facebook? What strategies and allow for alternative modes of engagement?

In this session, participants will learn how to build their own Facebook bot that automates user interactions in an effort to detourn the platformâ€™s engagement-based business model.
